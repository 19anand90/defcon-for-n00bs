A packet of soy sauce, a napkin, a rubber band and a plastic tumbler is a neat trick to see if your room has been entered.
Fill the tumbler 1/2 way with water, draw a symbol or letter on the napkin with the soy sauce and put it over the top of the glass. Secure it with the rubber band.
Then place this behind the door when you leave (but don't forget it's there!). If someone enters your room, the glass will get knocked over and the symbol or letter on the napkin will become unreadable.
