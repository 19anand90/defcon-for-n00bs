* DEFCON *

DEFCON generally needs no introduction. However, we are aware that there will be people not familiar with the security industry 
and culture attending. Sometimes they are sent by employers, sometimes they are just curious and happen to be in Vegas. For 
those who are unaware, all we will say here in the introduction is that the networks are some of the most hostile you will ever encounter, the Wall of 
Sheep is real and easy to get on, and this event is the combination of some of the most brilliant minds in industry and some of 
the most annoying pranksters/drunks. The history of DEFCON and its background are generally out of scope for this document, we 
recommend you UTFSE if you are still reading this and haven't moved on yet to the various sections.

The Essentials folder has guides for knowledge that, as the name suggests, is essential for the event. 
It includes topics such as:
- Securing your tech

and more. If any of the topicss present are unfamiliar to you, read them before heading to Tips and Tricks
