Traveling to and from the conference involves the usual (though as of this writing TSA lines are getting ludicrously long).
However, the Las Vegas airport is especially risky for stolen vlauables. If you don't have to check it, carry it. if you do, 
then I recommend you follow declared firearm procedures.
This trick involves getting a start pistol or soemthing else that is not an actual gun, but triggers requirements for airlines 
to handle like a regular firearm. This allows you to use a hard suitcase (like a pelican case) and lock it with actual locks 
rather than TSA locks.
TSA may ask for the key during inspection, but they relock it before it goes through. There is a standard process for doing 
this, and most airlines are not problematic. Look up your airline's policy for it.
