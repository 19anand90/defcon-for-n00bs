Be comfortable, stay cool. Las Vegas is very hot. It has been 100 degrees outside at night during this conference before.
So unless you really need it (or are trying to be cool and have plenty of ice water), don't bring the trenchcoat.

You will want to travel light and try to take only the things you will need for your stay. Swimwear, sunglasses and travel-size 
sunscreen are a must.

Again, keep things Comfortable. For the most part casual attire, unless you are on a corporate sponsorship that involves some 
fancy dinners or the like. Whilst most things in vegas can be casual (especially around the con), many restaurants and casino 
areas have dress codes. If you intend to stray from the con for one of these, slacks and a button down, or at the least polo, 
are recommneded. However, Vegas can be visited any time of year, and Defcon tends to take up the energy one might otherwise use 
on hookers and blackjack.
